2.0.0 / 2015-11-10
==================

The version 2.0.0 release refactors the Cloudinary JavaScript library, and the biggest news is that the newly introduced Core Library is jQuery-independent. The source code has been converted into CoffeeScript and rearranged into classes, and a new build script based on Grunt has been added. The build process produces 3 artifacts:

  * A Core Library that is not dependent on jQuery
  * A jQuery plugin that includes the Core Library
  * A Blueimp plugin that includes the jQuery plugin and the Core Library
  
In order to publish these libraries in bower and NPM, 3 new Github repositories have been created:

    +------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    | Repository                         | Package name                  |
    +------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    |  pkg-cloudinary-core               | cloudinary-core               |
    |  pkg-cloudinary-jquery             | cloudinary-jquery             |
    |  pkg-cloudinary-jquery-file-upload | cloudinary-jquery-file-upload | 
    +------------------------------------+-------------------------------+

The same package names are used in both bower and NPM.


## Backward compatibility
The cloudinary-jquery-file-upload library is fully backward compatible with cloudinary_js library 1.0.25.
The relevant Blueimp files will still be found in the `js` folder for backward compatibility. However if you rely on Blueimp files located in the repository's `js` folder, make sure to update your links to `load-image.all.min.js` which replaced the `load-image.min.js` from previous versions.
We however encourage developers to utilize a dependency manager such as bower or NPM to install 3 party libraries and not rely on the files in the `js` folder.
